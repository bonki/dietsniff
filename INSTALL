Revise the variables at the top of the Makefile and build it by
running "make".

You may install the resulting binary together with the manpage using
"make install".

Per default the includes of the libowfat are assumed in
/usr/include/libowfat (Gentoo-default). The binary and the manpage are
installed into /usr/local/sbin and /usr/local/man/man1 respectively.

Since 0.2 it is possible to include/exclude several features that blow
up the sourcecode while having a limited usefulness. You can switch
them on using the FEATURES-variable inside the Makefile.

Features supported so far:

  - USE_REV_RES: Use reverse DNS-lookups. While it's possible to
    switch them off at runtime, the code still takes up ~16K.

  - USE_PCAP: Include support for pcap-logs. This feature doesn't have
    a dramatical impact on the final size so you might want to keep it
    enabled.

  - USE_PACKET_STATISTICS: Display some packet statistics after
    sniffing.
