Welcome to dietsniff, the slim and static sniffer for Linux.

dietsniff is a network-debugging tool like tcpdump or ethereal. The
difference to those powerful tools however is that dietsniff is linked
against the dietlibc by Felix von Leitner and doesn't require the
libpcap. Therefore it's really small while being static. dietsniff's most
useful scenario is probably to sniff the packets into a pcap-logfile which
can be later viewed using more userfriendly applications.

Requirements:
	- Linux, tested with 2.4 and 2.6
	- dietlibc [http://www.fefe.de/dietlibc/], tested with 0.28
	- libowfat [http://www.fefe.de/libowfat/], tested with 0.22

The latest version can be found at http://ox.cx/dietsniff/ .

See the manpage for the usage.

Enjoy,
